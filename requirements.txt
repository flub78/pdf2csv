# Python requirements for pdf2csv
# This project primarily relies on system tools (pdftotext)
# but may require additional packages for CSV processing

# No additional Python packages required for basic functionality
# The script uses only standard library modules

# Future enhancements might require:
# pandas>=1.3.0  # For advanced CSV manipulation
# openpyxl>=3.0.0  # For Excel output support
