# Feature Specification: PDF to CSV Converter

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-pdf-to`  
**Created**: 10 septembre 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "a pdf to csv convertor"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: "a pdf to csv convertor"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: actors (users), actions (convert), data (PDF files, CSV files)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Multiple aspects need clarification (see requirements)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: user provides PDF, receives CSV
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Core conversion capability with format specifications needed
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí PDF files, CSV files, conversion process
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - multiple clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has a PDF file containing structured data (such as tables, reports, or statements) and needs to convert this data into a CSV format for use in spreadsheet applications, databases, or other systems that process tabular data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a PDF file with tabular data, **When** user initiates conversion, **Then** system produces a CSV file with the same data structure
2. **Given** a PDF file with multiple tables, **When** user converts the file, **Then** system extracts all tables into separate CSV sections or files
3. **Given** an invalid or corrupted PDF file, **When** user attempts conversion, **Then** system provides clear error message explaining the issue
4. **Given** a PDF with no extractable tabular data, **When** user converts it, **Then** system notifies user that no structured data was found

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PDF contains images instead of text-based tables?
- How does system handle password-protected PDF files?
- What occurs when PDF has complex formatting or merged cells?
- How are special characters and non-ASCII text handled in the output?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept PDF files as input for conversion
- **FR-002**: System MUST produce CSV files as output containing extracted tabular data
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve data structure and relationships from PDF tables
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What file size limits should be supported?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which PDF versions/standards should be supported?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST process [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What types of PDFs - forms, reports, statements, invoices?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST extract [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Text-only tables, or also images/scanned content?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST output CSV in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which CSV format - delimiter type, encoding, header handling?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Single table per PDF or multiple tables?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What level of user interaction - batch processing, GUI, command line?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate input files and provide meaningful error messages for unsupported formats
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain data accuracy during conversion process

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **PDF File**: Input document containing structured data, may include tables, forms, or reports
- **CSV File**: Output file containing extracted tabular data in comma-separated values format
- **Data Table**: Structured information within PDF that represents rows and columns of data
- **Conversion Job**: Process that transforms PDF content into CSV format, tracking status and results
